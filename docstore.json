Ideally, no person ought to suffer adverse consequences of his acts\nunless the same is established before a neutral arbiter. However, owing to the\npracticalities of real life where to secure an effective trial and to ameliorate\nthe risk to society in case a potential criminal is left at large pending trial, the\nCourts are tasked with deciding whether an individual ought to be released\npending trial or not. Once it is obvious that a timely trial would not be\npossible and the accused has suffered incarceration for a significant period of\ntime, Courts would ordinarily be obligated to enlarge them on bail.\"   \nConsidering  the  entire  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  case,\nsubmissions of learned counsel for the parties, nature of evidence\nand  all  attending  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  case,  without\nexpressing any opinion on merits of the case, the Court is of the\nview that the applicant has made out a case for bail. The bail\napplication is allowed. \nLet the applicant  Sandeep  in the aforesaid crime be released on\nbail on furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like\namount  to  the  satisfaction  of  court  concerned  subject  to  the\nfollowing conditions:   \n(1). The applicant will not tamper with the prosecution evidence\nduring the trial.\n(2). The applicant will not influence any witness.   \n(3). The applicant will appear before the trial Court on the date\nfixed, unless personal presence is exempted.   \n(4).  The  applicant  shall  not  directly  or  indirectly  make  any\ninducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the\nfacts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to\nthe Court to any police officer or tamper with the evidence.   \nIn case of breach of any of the above condition, the prosecution\nshall be at liberty to move an application before this Court seeking\ncancellation of the bail. \nOrder Date :- 11.12.2023\nMohit", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2303, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b48bc1e-27b9-4d87-8401-1e6131895758": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b48bc1e-27b9-4d87-8401-1e6131895758", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "BAIL_40650_2023_of_SHYAM_SUNDAR_Vs_STATE_OF_UP.pdf", "file_path": "/kaggle/input/legal-docs/BAIL_40650_2023_of_SHYAM_SUNDAR_Vs_STATE_OF_UP.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 50414, "creation_date": "2024-08-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f53af524-7b0d-4f4a-b48c-51d4fa534441", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "BAIL_40650_2023_of_SHYAM_SUNDAR_Vs_STATE_OF_UP.pdf", "file_path": "/kaggle/input/legal-docs/BAIL_40650_2023_of_SHYAM_SUNDAR_Vs_STATE_OF_UP.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 50414, "creation_date": "2024-08-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-07"}, "hash": "a4d065529e0ba38b141c4c974e1b0b11e0ac0c8a0fec2c26cc7032bb114a2bd5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Neutral Citation No. - 2023:AHC:215572\nCourt No. - 74\nCase :- CRIMINAL MISC.

Counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant was not\nnamed  in  the  first  information  report.  The  applicant  was\narrested on 11.07.2023 alongwith co-accused Aniket @ Zalim\nand Bachchi Lal Gaud and has been implicated in the instant\ncase.

Learned counsel appearing on behalf of opposite parties 2\nand 3 has refuted submissions advanced by learned counsel for\npetitioner on the premise that since petitioner's late husband had\nnot completed period of one year probation, it can not be said\nthat he was regular employee of the department due to which\npetitioner would not be covered in terms of Rule 2 of the Rules\nof 1974. It is also submitted that as has been indicated in the\nimpugned order, since petitioner's late husband did not fulfil the\nconditions of Rule 2 of the Rules 1974, no benefit can accrue to\npetitioner who is the wife of deceased.\n6.  Upon  consideration  of  submissions  advanced  by  learned\ncounsel  for  parties  and  perusal  of  material  on  record\nparticularly  the  impugned  order,  it  is  quite  evident  that\npetitioner's application for appointment on compassionate basis\nhas been rejected only on the ground that since petitioner's late\nhusband did not complete period of probation, he can not be\ndeemed  to  be  a  regular  employee  of  the  department  and\ntherefore  neither  he  nor  the  petitioner  would  come  within\ndefinition of Rule 2 of Rules of 1974.\n7. The aforesaid proposition of law is no longer res integra and\nit  has  already  been  held  that  nature  of  compassionate\nappointment  is  substantive  from  the  very  first  day  of\nappointment as has been held in Full Bench decision in the case\nof Senior General Manager Ordnance Factory(supra) wherein\nquestion No.2 has specifically been answered that appointment\nof a person on compassionate ground can be made on probation\nbut is deemed to be a regular appointment and not temporary.\nThe same analogy has also been taken in the case of Ravi Karan\nSingh (supra). \n8.  In  view  of  settled  law  that  appointment  made  on\ncompassionate basis under Rules of 1974 is regular in nature,\nthe very basis of impugned order is therefore in violation of\nsuch settled law. It is therefore held that petitioner' late husband\nwho admittedly was appointed on compassionate basis in terms\nof Rules of 1974 was a regular employee of the department due\nto  which  he  as  well  as  the  petitioner  would  come  within\ndefinition of Rule 2 of Rules of 1974. \n9.
